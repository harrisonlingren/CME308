		<h3>JavaScript Assignment</h3>
		<p>This assignment will combine  what you have learned so far in this class. Below you will find a grade calculator. Here is how it will function:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The total points available is 500. This value is held as a variable in your JavaScript file. Use this along with the number entered in your input field to figure out the grade percentage.</li>
			<li>The percentage will be displayed in the paragraph element with the <i>answer</i> id.</li>
			<li>Once you figure out the percentage, the grade and grade range that your percentage falls in will be highlighted in red.</li>
			<li>Once you type in another grade in the input field, the highlighted field will go back to white.</li>
			<li>You will only need to write two functions to make this page work</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Add the link to your javascript file DIRECTLY BEFORE your CLOSING BODY TAG. Yes you read that right - before the \<\/body\>. </p>
		
		<p>You will have a week to finish this assignment. It will be due BEFORE next Tuesday's class.</p>
